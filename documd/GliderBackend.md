# Glider Backend Service
**v1.0.3**

This is the section of Glider where you can find how to run directly the Glider's backend without need to
implement it anywhere

## First configuration

In the first configuration you need to customize this JSON snippet with your preferences, following the hints written as 
values of the "configuration" branch, then save it.

```json
{
  "glider": {
    "configuration": {
      "backupPath" : "[STRING] -> insert your path here, also null or this key removed is valid",
      "backupInterval": "[STRING] -> insert the interval to schedule the database backup (null or remove this key to not set a scheduled backup) -> [FIVE_MINUTES, FIFTEEN_MINUTES, HALF_HOUR, ONE_HOUR, FOUR_HOURS, EIGHT_HOURS, TWELVE_HOURS, ONE_DAY, ONE_WEEK, ONE_MONTH]",
      "databasePath": "[STRING] -> path where create the database",
      "password": "[STRING] -> password to protect the Session",
      "singleUseMode": "[BOOLEAN] -> whether the session allows multiple connections, so multiple devices",
      "QRCodeLoginEnabled": "[BOOLEAN] -> whether the session allows login by QR-CODE method\n (if enabled will be shown on hostAddress:(hostPort + 1))",
      "hostAddress": "[STRING] -> host address of the session (null or remove this key to auto-fetch it)",
      "hostPort": "[INTEGER] -> host port of the session",
      "runInLocalhost": "[BOOLEAN] -> whether the session can accept requests outside localhost"
    }
  }
}
```

To found that snippet you need to:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>open the alinktojarfilea file as archive, and not launch it</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        navigate to <b>"resources"</b> folder
    </li>
    <li>
        find the configuration file saved as <b>"glider_configs.json"</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        customize the <b>"glider_configs.json"</b> file
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>save that file with the same name, or the backend service will not work</b>
    </li>
</ul>

## Next launches 

After the first configuration that snippet will appear like this, and you can directly run the alinktojarfilea without 
change any details to make work the backend service

```json
{
  "glider": {
    "configuration": {
      "backupPath" : "[STRING] -> insert your path here, also null or this key removed is valid",
      "backupInterval": "[STRING] -> insert the interval to schedule the database backup (null or remove this key to not set a scheduled backup) -> [FIVE_MINUTES, FIFTEEN_MINUTES, HALF_HOUR, ONE_HOUR, FOUR_HOURS, EIGHT_HOURS, TWELVE_HOURS, ONE_DAY, ONE_WEEK, ONE_MONTH]",
      "databasePath": "[STRING] -> path where create the database",
      "password": "[STRING] -> password to protect the Session",
      "singleUseMode": "[BOOLEAN] -> whether the session allows multiple connections, so multiple devices",
      "QRCodeLoginEnabled": "[BOOLEAN] -> whether the session allows login by QR-CODE method\n (if enabled will be shown on hostAddress:(hostPort + 1))",
      "hostAddress": "[STRING] -> host address of the session (null or remove this key to auto-fetch it)",
      "hostPort": "[INTEGER] -> host port of the session",
      "runInLocalhost": "[BOOLEAN] -> whether the session can accept requests outside localhost"
    },
    // this section will be created and filled after the first run of Glider with this system
    "session" : {
      "secretKey": "[STRING] -> secret key of current the session",
      "databasePath": "[STRING] -> path where the database has been created",
      "ivSpec": "[STRING] -> iv spec of current the session",
      "token": "[STRING] -> token of the current session"
    }
  }
}
``` 

### Change configuration

If you need to change some details you need to follow these options: 
<ul>
    <li>
        If you need to change any configuration details you need to remove the <b>"session"</b> branch or the changes
        will not have any effects for the backend service 
    </li>
    <li>
        If you need to change the session, without change any configuration details, you can directly change the 
        <b>"session"</b> branch without remove the <b>"configuration"</b> branch
    </li>
</ul> 

<b>After the change of the configuration you will need to restart the alinktojarfilea file</b> to correctly configure 
the backend service
